Details of Migrating From Macs + Drobo to Mixed Windows (Primary)/Linux/Mac + Synology


For day to day computing tasks, 2012 Retina MacBook Pro is being replaced by 2022 Razer Blade 17

Common applications used on the RMBP and their replacements are:

- **Web Browsing**: Vivaldi (Mac) --> Vivaldi (Windows)

Also intend to gradually migrate functions from 2013 Mac Pro to the 2022 Razer Blade 17 and from Drobo 5D to Synology DS 1825+


Expected Challenges and Obstacles:

- Migrate iTunes library to Windows (preserving play counts, ratings, playlists and smart playlists)
- Migrate cable-sync of iOS devices (ensuring live photos are preserved)
- Migrate Lightroom Library (ideally taking the opportunity to have iPhone live photos preserved)
